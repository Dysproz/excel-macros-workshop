# Variable types

## Integer
Integer represents whole number (so values with commas will be transformed into whole numbers dropping the information about values after comma). Integer is 32-bits registry, so it may contain any whole number from -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647.

## Double
Double is more precise representation of numbers, because it allows to store values after comma of numbers.

## String
String is a representation of text. It's usually written using "" to recognise it from other instructions in code.
String may contain maximum of 2^31 characters.

## Boolean
Boolean contains True/False value.
